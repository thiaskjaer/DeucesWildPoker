# DeucesWildPoker
An excerpt of the files created for a deuces wild poker game, made as a project for the class Software Engineering at Southern Utah University, in collaboration with the company Casino Game Maker.


These files show the main workings of the game Deuces Wild Poker, coded using ActionScript 3.
Deuces Wild Poker is a 5-hand poker game, where the goal is to get the highest hand possible.
2's count as wild cards, meaning they take the form of the best possible card for the hand given.
The lowest paying hand is three of a kind, and the highest is a royal flush.


The GAME class initializes the game and contains the main game loop and UI functionality.

The Card and Deck classes are representations of cards and decks as objects, making it easier to conceptualize them in the game.

The WIN class contains methods for checking all the possible win cases that a hand can have. Each win condition is represented as a method, which accepts a hand (array) of five card objects. 


Due to some proprietary code used from Casino Game Maker to make the game window work, only an excpert of the game source code is hosted.
